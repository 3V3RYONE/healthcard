# NFC-based Patient Information Retrieval System

## Overview

The NFC-based Patient Information Retrieval System is a college project that utilizes Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to fetch medical and other essential details of a patient quickly and efficiently. This system eliminates the need for patients to wait in queues and manually fill out their medical information. By registering an NFC card with the patient's details through a website, a unique link is generated. When the NFC card is scanned and the link is opened, the complete medical profile of the patient is retrieved instantly.

## Features

- **NFC Technology:** The project leverages NFC technology to enable seamless communication between the NFC card and the system. This ensures quick and convenient retrieval of patient information without the need for physical paperwork or manual data entry.

- **Online Registration:** Patients can register their NFC cards through a website by providing their medical and personal details. This information is securely stored in a database and associated with a unique link that is encoded onto the NFC card.

- **Instant Access:** When the NFC card is scanned and the link is opened, the system retrieves the patient's complete medical profile instantly. This eliminates the need for patients to repeat their medical history or wait for manual data entry, leading to faster and more efficient healthcare services.

## Requirements

To utilize the NFC-based Patient Information Retrieval System, the following requirements must be met:

- **NFC Card:** Obtain NFC cards compatible with the system's NFC technology. These cards should be capable of storing a unique link.

- **Web Server:** Set up a web server with the necessary backend technologies to handle patient registration, data storage, and link generation.

- **Database:** Configure a database system to securely store patient information, including medical and personal details, associated with the generated links.
